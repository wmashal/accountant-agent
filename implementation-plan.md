## Phase 3 — PDF Support ✅ Complete

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | PDFs sent directly to Gemini Vision (application/pdf mime) | ✅ |

## Phase 4 — Claude Fallback + Storage + Confirmation ✅ Complete

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|

| 4.2 | `app/services/claude_client.py` — Anthropic API fallback (images only) | ✅ |
| 4.3 | Fallback: invalid Gemini output → Claude retry for images | ✅ |
| 4.4 | Local disk file storage (`app/services/local_storage.py`) | ✅ |
| 4.5 | File URL stored in Postgres `receipts.file_url` | ✅ |
| 4.6 | Confirmation via Redis `pending:<from>` → JSON list of SIDs | ✅ |

## Phase 8 — Hardening ⬜ Pending

| # | Task | Priority |

| 8.2 | Unit tests: normalize, ABN validator, extraction prompt | Medium |
| 8.3 | Integration test with mock Twilio webhook payload | Medium |
| 8.4 | Cron: auto-expire `pending_confirmation` rows older than 7 days | Low |
| 8.5 | Test with degraded images (dark, skewed, crumpled) | Low |
